  abstract  = "Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all
               areas of society and technology and yet model based science is
               increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are
               applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the
               environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs
               are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these
               numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human
               health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity
               analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard.
               Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into
               inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining
               to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often
               arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what
               extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of
               these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global
               Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such
               problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with
               the first principles and guiding the reader through the full
               range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved
               exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity
               analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and
               provides a guide to potential applications. The book: Provides a
               self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to
               learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further
               materials. Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its
               results, and avoid potential pitfalls. Features numerous
               exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the
               applications. Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis
               practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds.
               Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of

               statistical model building in any scientific discipline where
               modelling takes place. For a non-expert, choosing the method of
               analysis for their model is complex, and depends on a number of

               in order to enable them to choose and apply the most appropriate
               method. It offers a review of the state-of-the-art in

               of Paris, London, Rhine-Ruhr area (Germany) and the Po-valley
               (Italy). It is shown that the allocation of the emission in the
               regional top-down inventory can deviate substantially from the
               megacity bottom-up inventories. For example, the PM10 and NOx in
               local inventories are respectively 26\% and 62\% (London), 33\%
               and 95\% (Paris), 55\% and 108\% (Rhine-Ruhr) and 110\% and
               107\% (Po valley) of the emission allocated to the same area in
               the regional inventory. The match for the Po Valley is
               reasonable but if we zoom in on a city level (Milan) similar
               problems as seen in Paris and London surface. We conclude that
               the European scale inventory is consistent with official
               reported national emissions but local-national-regional scale
               inventories are not consistent. Since the discrepancies are
               large, predicted concentrations and population exposure
               estimates may be significantly different. Our work shows the
               importance of regionalization of emissions for model input and
               argues that consistency between emission inventories at
               different scales deserves more attention.",

               Americans are more pragmatic than ideological in their opinions
               about energy alternatives, more unified than divided about their
               main concerns, and more local than global in their approach to
               energy.Drawing on extensive surveys they designed and conducted
               over the course of a decade (in conjunction with MIT's Energy
               Initiative), Ansolabehere and Konisky report that beliefs about
               the costs and environmental harms associated with particular
               fuels drive public opinions about energy. People approach energy
               choices as consumers, and what is most important to them is
               simply that energy be cheap and clean. Most of us want energy at
               low economic cost and with little social cost (that is, minimal
               health risk from pollution). The authors also find that although
               environmental concerns weigh heavily in people's energy
               preferences, these concerns are local and not global. Worries
               about global warming are less pressing to most than worries
               about their own city's smog and toxic waste. With this in mind,
               Ansolabehere and Konisky argue for policies that target both
               local pollutants and carbon emissions (the main source of global
               warming). The local and immediate nature of people's energy
               concerns can be the starting point for a new approach to energy
               and climate change policy.",

  abstract    = "Simulations of building energy use can give insights into how
                 energy efficiency retrofits and operational changes can
                 influence a building's total and temporal energy use. However,
                 before those models are used to generate recommendations, it
                 is important to understand how accurately the simulations
                 predict actual energy use. This paper seeks to determine model
                 accuracy by considering 54 homes in Austin, TX that are part
                 of a smart grid demonstration project. Data about the homes
                 were collected with energy audits then converted into energy
                 models using BEopt (version 2.0), a residential
                 building-focused graphical user interface (GUI) front-end for
                 EnergyPlus developed by NREL. Actual meter reads (kW h) were
                 compared to simulation results for four cases: (1) energy
                 model output with typical meteorological year (TMY) weather
                 data, (2) output with an actual meteorological year weather
                 (AMY) file created using real weather data from a year during
                 which actual energy use measurements were made, (3) model
                 output with thermostat user behavior data, and (4) output
                 using a simplified home geometry. The purpose of this analysis
                 was to evaluate how well this model, as it is, could be
                 expected to predict energy usage using varying levels of
                 inputs that might be included on an energy audit and survey.
                 Results indicate that the modeling software was able to
                 estimate aggregate annual electrical energy usage within 1\%
                 (for groups of homes) but might vary up to 28\% (absolute) for
                 an individual home. Using AMY weather data (Case 2) yielded
                 results within 2.4\% of measured (aggregate) energy use, while
                 using a TMY3 weather file for Austin yielded results within
                 9\% of (aggregate) actual usage. Using a simplified home
                 geometry did not appreciably change the results of the model
                 or its ability to simulate real usage. Results show that while
                 the model does a reasonable job predicting usage for homes
                 with average usage, the model has trouble predicting usage of
                 homes with low or high consumption, particularly homes below 5
                 kW h/ft2/year (0.47 kW h/m2/year) of average energy use or
                 above 10 kW h/ft2/year (0.93 kW h/m2/year), likely due to
                 unknowns about the home when BEopt defaults were used.

  abstract  = "Efforts to control climate change require the stabilization of
               atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This can only be achieved
               through a drastic reduction of global CO2 emissions. Yet fossil
               fuel emissions increased by 29\% between 2000 and 2008, in
               conjunction with increased contributions from emerging
               economies, from the production and international trade of goods
               and services, and from the use of coal as a fuel source. In
               contrast, emissions from land-use changes were nearly constant.
               Between 1959 and 2008, 43\% of each year's CO2 emissions
               remained in the atmosphere on average; the rest was absorbed by
               carbon sinks on land and in the oceans. In the past 50 years,
               the fraction of CO2 emissions that remains in the atmosphere
               each year has likely increased, from about 40\% to 45\%, and
               models suggest that this trend was caused by a decrease in the
               uptake of CO2 by the carbon sinks in response to climate change
               and variability. Changes in the CO2 sinks are highly uncertain,
               but they could have a significant influence on future

  abstract = "This paper provides a review on three streams of life cycle
              studies that have been frequently applied to evaluate the
              environmental impacts of building construction with a major focus
              on whether they can be used for decision making. The three
              streams are Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Energy
              Assessment (LCEA) and Life Cycle Carbon Emissions Assessment
              (LCCO2A). They were compared against their evaluation objectives,
              methodologies, and findings. Although they share similar
              objectives in evaluating the environmental impacts over the life
              cycle of building construction, they show some differences in the
              major focuses of evaluation and methodologies employed.
              Generally, it has been revealed that quite consistent results can
              be derived from the three streams with regard to the relative
              contribution of different phases of life cycle. However,
              discrepancies occur among the findings obtained from the three
              streams when different compositions of fuel mixes are used in
              power generation, or when the overall impacts are not contributed
              mostly by greenhouse gases emissions. The use of different
              functional units in different studies also makes it difficult to
              compare results with benchmarks or results from previous studies.
              Besides, there are drawbacks in boundary scoping, methodology
              framework, data inventory and practices which impair their
              usefulness as a decision making support tool for sustainable

                 effects of anthropogenic aerosols on the Pacific storm track,
                 using a multiscale global aerosol-climate model (GCM).
                 Simulations of two aerosol scenarios corresponding to the
                 present day and preindustrial conditions reveal long-range
                 transport of anthropogenic aerosols across the north Pacific
                 and large resulting changes in the aerosol optical depth,
                 cloud droplet number concentration, and cloud and ice water
                 paths. Shortwave and longwave cloud radiative forcing at the
                 top of atmosphere are changed by -2.5 and +1.3 W m(-2),
                 respectively, by emission changes from preindustrial to
                 present day, and an increased cloud top height indicates
                 invigorated midlatitude cyclones. The overall increased

                 intensification of the Pacific storm track by anthropogenic

                 Asian pollution outflows from GCMs. Furthermore, our results

              the models are classified in terms of their application range and
              goal. We then describe how the early mathematical models, mainly
              physical models applied to conventional buildings, have faced new
              challenges for the design and management of intelligent buildings
              and led to the use of models which offer more flexibility to
              better cope with various uncertainties. In contrast with the
              early modelling techniques, model approaches adopted in neural
              networks, expert systems, fuzzy logic and genetic models provide
              a promising method to accommodate these complications as
              intelligent buildings now need integrated technologies which
              involve solving complex, multi-objective and integrated decision
              problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

  abstract = "The promotion of the exploitation of renewable sources in the
              built environment has led to the spread of multi-energy systems
              in buildings. These systems use more than one energy source in
              various energy converters to overcome the limitations that may be
              characteristic of each source. However, the design of the
              optimization of such systems is a complex task because the number
              of design variables is high and the boundary conditions (climate,
              operation strategies, etc.) are highly variable, so the system
              simulation has to be performed in the time domain. In this work
              an original hourly model to optimize multi-energy systems is
              presented and applied on a case study. It is an evaluation method
              to assess, in an integrated fashion, the performance of a
              building system as a whole and the viability of the exploitation
              of various energy sources. This tool is intended to take into
              account the variation of the conversion efficiency as a function
              of the design power, part load, boundary and climatic conditions.
              The relations that can model the energy converters of the case
              study (standard boiler, condensing boiler, various types of
              chillers and others) from the energy performance and from the
              financial points of view are also presented. This model
              represents a valuable alternative to currently available tools
              for hybrid systems simulation because of the optimization
              approach and of the detail in the thermal energy converters
              performance. Ultimately, the theoretical and applied knowledge of
              this contribution aims also at promoting a more conscious use of
              renewable and non-renewable energy in the built environment. ??

  abstract = "Historically, economic development has been strongly correlated
              with increasing energy use and growth of greenhouse gas (GHG)
              emissions. Renewable energy (RE) can help decouple that
              correlation, contributing to sustainable development (SD). In
              addition, RE offers the opportunity to improve access to modern
              energy services for the poorest members of society, which is
              crucial for the achievement of any single of the eight Millennium
              Development Goals. Theoretical concepts of SD can provide useful
              frameworks to assess the interactions between SD and RE. SD
              addresses concerns about relationships between human society and
              nature. Traditionally, SD has been framed in the three-pillar
              model---Economy, Ecology, and Society---allowing a schematic
              categorization of development goals, with the three pillars being
              interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Within another
              conceptual framework, SD can be oriented along a continuum
              between the two paradigms of weak sustainability and strong
              sustainability. The two paradigms differ in assumptions about the
              substitutability of natural and human-made capital. RE can
              contribute to the development goals of the three-pillar model and
              can be assessed in terms of both weak and strong SD, since RE
              utilization is deﬁ ned as sustaining natural capital as long as
              its resource use does not reduce the potential for future
              harvest. The relationship between RE and SD can be viewed as a
              hierarchy of goals and constraints that involve both global and
              regional or local considerations. Though the exact contribution
              of RE to SD has to be evaluated in a country speciﬁ c context, RE
              offers the opportunity to contribute to a number of important SD
              goals: (1) social and economic development; (2) energy access;
              (3) energy security; (4) climate change mitigation and the
              reduction of environmental and health impacts. The mitigation of
              dangerous anthropogenic climate change is seen as one strong
              driving force behind the increased use of RE worldwide. The
              chapter provides an overview of the scientiﬁ c literature on the
              relationship between these four SD goals and RE and, at times,
              fossil and nuclear energy technologies. The assessments are based
              on different methodological tools, including bottom-up indicators
              derived from attributional lifecycle assessments (LCA) or energy
              statistics, dynamic integrated modelling approaches, and
              qualitative analyses. Countries at different levels of
              development have different incentives and socioeconomic SD goals
              to advance RE. The creation of employment opportunities and
              actively promoting structural change in the economy are seen,
              especially in industrialized countries, as goals that support the
              promotion of RE. However, the associated costs are a major factor
              determining the desirability of RE to meet increasing energy
              demand and concerns have been voiced that increased energy prices
              might endanger industrializing countries’ development prospects;
              this underlines the need for a concomitant discussion about the
              details of an international burden-sharing regime. Still,
              decentralized grids based on RE have expanded and already
              improved energy access in developing countries. Under favorable
              conditions, cost savings in comparison to non-RE use exist, in
              particular in remote areas and in poor rural areas lacking
              centralized energy access. In addition, non-electrical RE
              technologies offer opportunities for modernization of energy
              services, for example, using solar energy for water heating and
              crop drying, biofuels for transportation, biogas and modern
              biomass for heating, cooling, cooking and lighting, and wind for
              water pumping. RE deployment can contribute to energy security by
              diversifying energy sources and diminishing dependence on a
              limited number of suppliers, therefore reducing the economy’s
              vulnerability to price volatility. Many developing countries
              speciﬁ cally link energy access and security issues to include
              stability and reliability of local supply in their deﬁ nition of
              energy security. Supporting the SD goal to mitigate environmental
              impacts from energy systems, RE technologies can provide
              important beneﬁ ts compared to fossil fuels, in particular
              regarding GHG emissions. Maximizing these beneﬁ ts often depends
              on the speciﬁ c technology, management, and site characteristics
              associated with each RE project, especially with respect to land
              use change (LUC) impacts. Lifecycle assessments for electricity
              generation indicate that GHG emissions from RE technologies are,
              in general, considerably lower than those associated with fossil
              fuel options, and in a range of conditions, less than fossil
              fuels employing carbon capture and storage (CCS). The maximum
              estimate for concentrating solar power (CSP), geothermal,
              hydropower, ocean and wind energy is less 711 Chapter 9 Renewable
              Energy in the Context of Sustainable Development than or equal to
              100 g CO 2 eq/kWh, and median values for all RE range from 4 to
              46 g CO 2 eq/kWh. The GHG balances of bioenergy production,
              however, have considerable uncertainties, mostly related to land
              management and LUC. Excluding LUC, most bioenergy systems reduce
              GHG emissions compared to fossil-fuelled systems and can lead to
              avoided GHG emissions from residues and wastes in landﬁ ll
              disposals and co-products; the combination of bioenergy with CCS
              may provide for further reductions. For transport fuels, some ﬁ
              rst-generation biofuels result in relatively modest GHG
              mitigation potential, while most next-generation biofuels could
              provide greater climate beneﬁ ts. To optimize beneﬁ ts from
              bioenergy production, it is critical to reduce uncertainties and
              to consider ways to mitigate the risk of bioenergy-induced LUC.
              RE technologies can also offer beneﬁ ts with respect to air
              pollution and health. Non-combustion-based RE power generation
              technologies have the potential to signiﬁ cantly reduce local and
              regional air pollution and lower associated health impacts
              compared to fossil-based power generation. Impacts on water and
              biodiversity, however, depend on local conditions. In areas where
              water scarcity is already a concern, non-thermal RE technologies
              or thermal RE technologies using dry cooling can provide energy
              services without additional stress on water resources.
              Conventional water-cooled thermal power plants may be especially
              vulnerable to conditions of water scarcity and climate change.
              Hydropower and some bioenergy systems are dependent on water
              availability, and can either increase competition or mitigate
              water scarcity. RE speciﬁ c impacts on biodiversity may be
              positive or negative; the degree of these impacts will be
              determined by site-speciﬁ c conditions. Accident risks of RE
              technologies are not negligible, but the technologies’ often
              decentralized structure strongly limits the potential for
              disastrous consequences in terms of fatalities. However, dams
              associated with some hydropower projects may create a speciﬁ c
              risk depending on site-speciﬁ c factors. The scenario literature
              that describes global mitigation pathways for RE deployment can
              provide some insights into associated SD implications. Putting an
              upper limit on future GHG emissions results in welfare losses
              (usually measured as gross domestic product or consumption
              foregone), disregarding the costs of climate change impacts.
              These welfare losses are based on assumptions about the
              availability and costs of mitigation technologies and increase
              when the availability of technological alternatives for
              constraining GHGs, for example, RE technologies, is limited.
              Scenario analyses show that developing countries are likely to
              see most of the expansion of RE production. Increasing energy
              access is not necessarily beneﬁ cial for all aspects of SD, as a
              shift to modern energy away from, for example, traditional
              biomass could simply be a shift to fossil fuels. In general,
              available scenario analyses highlight the role of policies and ﬁ
              nance for increased energy access, even though forced shifts to
              RE that would provide access to modern energy services could
              negatively affect household budgets. To the extent that RE
              deployment in mitigation scenarios contributes to diversifying
              the energy portfolio, it has the potential to enhance energy
              security by making the energy system less susceptible to (sudden)
              energy supply disruption. In scenarios, this role of RE will vary
              with the energy form. With appropriate carbon mitigation policies
              in place, electricity generation can be relatively easily
              decarbonized through RE sources that have the potential to
              replace concentrated and increasingly scarce fossil fuels in the
              building and industry sectors. By contrast, the demand for liquid
              fuels in the transport sector remains inelastic if no
              technological breakthrough can be achieved. Therefore oil and
              related energy security concerns are likely to continue to play a
              role in the future global energy system; as compared to today
              these will be seen more prominently in developing countries. In
              order to take account of environmental and health impacts from
              energy systems, several models have included explicit
              representation of these, such as sulphate pollution. Some
              scenario results show that climate policy can help drive
              improvements in local air pollution (i.e., particulate matter),
              but air pollution reduction policies alone do not necessarily
              drive reductions in GHG emissions. Another implication of some
              potential energy trajectories is the possible diversion of land
              to support biofuel production. Scenario results have pointed at
              the possibility that climate policy could drive widespread
              deforestation if not accompanied by other policy measures, with
              land use being shifted to bioenergy crops with possibly adverse
              SD implications, including GHG emissions.712 Renewable Energy in

  abstract = "Energy simulation tools are increasingly used for analysis of
              energy performance of buildings and the thermal comfort of their
              occupants. This paper describes a selection of energy simulation
              engines and user interfaces that are capable of these analyses
              today. Specifically, it discusses the usage of these tools over
              different life-cycle stages. Besides a brief overview about
              energy simulation concepts, the paper illustrates each tool’s
              strengths and weaknesses as well as its data exchange
              capabilities. Given the significant variety of such energy
              simulation tools, it is crucial to understand limitations of the
              tools and the complexity of such simulations. The reliability of
              data exchange and straightforward, user-friendly interfaces are
              major aspects of the practical usage of these tools. Due to the
              huge amount of input data and the availability of rich 3D
              geometry models effective data exchange and software interfaces
              are crucial to enable faster and more reliable energy performance

              of life cycle assessment (LCA) in the building sector, providing
              a list of existing tools, drivers and barriers, potential users
              and purposes of LCA studies in this sector. It also proposes a
              simplified LCA methodology and applies this to a case study
              focused on Spain. The thermal simulation tools considered in the
              Spanish building energy certification standards are analysed and
              complemented with a simplified LCA methodology for evaluating the
              impact of certain improvements to the building design. The
              simplified approach proposed allows global comparisons between
              the embodied energy and emissions of the building materials and
              the energy consumption and associated emissions at the use stage.
              The results reveal that embodied energy can represent more than
              30\% of the primary energy requirement during the life span of a
              single house of 222 m2 with a garage for one car. The
              contribution of the building materials decreases if the house
              does not include a parking area, since this increases the heated
              surface percentage. Usually the top cause of energy consumption
              in residential building is heating, but the second is the
              building materials, which can represent more than 60\% of the

  abstract = "Indirect radiative forcing of atmospheric aerosols by
              modification of cloud processes poses the largest uncertainty in
              climate prediction. We show here a trend of increasing deep
              convective clouds over the Pacific Ocean in winter from long-term
              satellite cloud measurements (1984-2005). Simulations with a
              cloud-resolving weather research and forecast model reveal that
              the increased deep convective clouds are reproduced when
              accounting for the aerosol effect from the Asian pollution
              outflow, which leads to large-scale enhanced convection and
              precipitation and hence an intensified storm track over the
              Pacific. We suggest that the wintertime Pacific is highly
              vulnerable to the aerosol-cloud interaction because of favorable
              cloud dynamical and microphysical conditions from the coupling
              between the Pacific storm track and Asian pollution outflow. The
              intensified Pacific storm track is climatically significant and
              represents possibly the first detected climate signal of the
              aerosol-cloud interaction associated with anthropogenic
              pollution. In addition to radiative forcing on climate,
              intensification of the Pacific storm track likely impacts the
              global general circulation due to its fundamental role in

              The observations are interpreted with a global 3-D chemical
              transport model (GEOS-Chem). OMI NO2 satellite observations
              constrain Asian anthropogenic NOx emissions and indicate a factor

              of CO from AIRS and TES indicate two major events of Asian
              transpacific pollution during INTEX-B. Correlation between TES CO
              and ozone observations shows evidence for transpacific ozone
              pollution. The semi-permanent Pacific High and Aleutian Low cause
              splitting of transpacific pollution plumes over the Northeast
              Pacific. The northern branch circulates around the Aleutian Low

              circulates around the Pacific High and some of that air impacts

              results show sustained ozone production driven by

              roughly doubling the transpacific influence from ozone produced

              to zero. We first set the information network topology such that
              the prosumers exchange price (power) information with their
              neighbors according to a chosen information network topology.
              Based on the exchanged information and the prosumers own measured
              power demand, each prosumer uses a local control strategy to turn
              on and off its power generator to cooperatively achieve the
              global balance. More specifically, the local control strategy
              results from a distributed model predictive control method based
              on dual decomposition and sub-gradient iterations. The method
              achieves a unique dynamic price signal for each prosumer.

              the estimates of GHG emissions by aligning the assumptions,
              parameters, and system boundaries. During the initial screening
              we eliminated abstracts, short conference papers, presentations
              without supporting documentation, and unrelated analyses; 91
              studies passed this initial screening. In the primary screening
              we applied rigorous criteria for completeness of reporting,
              validity of analysis methods, and modern relevance of the PV
              system studied. Additionally, we examined whether the product is
              a commercial one, whether the production line still exists, and
              whether the study's core data are original or secondary. These
              screenings produced five studies as the best representations of
              the carbon footprint of modern thin-film PV technologies. These
              were harmonized through alignment of efficiency, irradiation,
              performance ratio, balance of system, and lifetime. The resulting
              estimates for carbon footprints are 20, 14, and 26 grams carbon
              dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh),

              Harmonization for the rooftop PV systems with a performance ratio
              of 0.75 and the same irradiation resulted in carbon footprint
              estimates of 21, 14, and 27 g CO2-eq/kWh, respectively, for the

              published work, variability in results hinders generalized

              deployed can have a significant impact on the magnitude of life
              cycle GHG emissions relative to renewable technologies. Screening
              274 references yielded 27 that reported 99 independent estimates
              of life cycle GHG emissions from light water reactors (LWRs). The

              increase domestic production and reserve estimates for the United
              States and internationally. This trend has led to lowered prices
              and increased scrutiny on production practices. Questions have
              been raised as to how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the
              life cycle of shale gas production and use compares with that of
              conventionally produced natural gas or other fuel sources such as
              coal. Recent literature has come to different conclusions on this
              point, largely due to differing assumptions, comparison
              baselines, and system boundaries. Through a meta-analytical
              procedure we call harmonization, we develop robust, analytically
              consistent, and updated comparisons of estimates of life cycle
              GHG emissions for electricity produced from shale gas,
              conventionally produced natural gas, and coal. On a per-unit
              electrical output basis, harmonization reveals that median
              estimates of GHG emissions from shale gas-generated electricity
              are similar to those for conventional natural gas, with both
              approximately half that of the central tendency of coal.
              Sensitivity analysis on the harmonized estimates indicates that
              assumptions regarding liquids unloading and estimated ultimate
              recovery (EUR) of wells have the greatest influence on life cycle
              GHG emissions, whereby shale gas life cycle GHG emissions could
              approach the range of best-performing coal-fired generation under
              certain scenarios. Despite clarification of published estimates

              are made to transform current energy systems. Renewable energy
              sources have a large potential to displace emissions of
              greenhouse gases from the combustion of fossil fuels and thereby
              to mitigate climate change. If implemented properly, renewable
              energy sources can contribute to social and economic development,
              to energy access, to a secure and sustainable energy supply, and
              to a reduction of negative impacts of energy provision on the
              environment and human health. This Special Report on Renewable
              Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) impartially
              assesses the scientifi c literature on the potential role of
              renewable energy in the mitigation of climate change for
              policymakers, the private sector, academic researchers and civil
              society. It covers six renewable energy sources -- bioenergy,
              direct solar energy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy
              and wind energy -- as well as their integration into present and
              future energy systems. It considers the environmental and social
              consequences associated with the deployment of these
              technologies, and presents strategies to overcome technical as
              well as non-technical obstacles to their application and
              diffusion. The authors also compare the levelized cost of energy
              from renewable energy sources to recent non-renewable energy
              costs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is

              (LCAs) have been conducted and published for a variety of
              residential and utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.
              These LCAs have yielded wide-ranging results. Variation could be
              attributed to differences in technologies evaluated (i.e.,
              differing system designs, commercial versus conceptual systems,
              system operating assumptions, technology improvements over time)
              and LCA methods and assumptions. The National Renewable Energy
              Laboratory (NREL) recently led the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
              Harmonization Project, a study that helps to clarify inconsistent
              and conflicting life cycle GHG emission estimates in the
              published literature and provide more precise estimates of life
              cycle GHG emissions from PV systems. Analysts developed and
              applied a systematic approach to review LCA literature, identify
              primary sources of variability and, where possible, reduce
              variability in life cycle GHG emissions estimates through a

@BOOK{Caradonna2014-fa,
  title     = "Sustainability: A History",
  author    = "Caradonna, Jeremy L",
  abstract  = "The word is nearly ubiquitous: at the grocery store we shop for
               ``sustainable foods'' that were produced from ``sustainable
               agriculture''; groups ranging from small advocacy organizations
               to city and state governments to the United Nations tout
               ``sustainable development'' as a strategy for local and global
               stability; and woe betide the city-dweller who doesn't aim for a
               ``sustainable lifestyle.'' Seeming to have come out of nowhere
               to dominate the discussion-from permaculture to renewable energy
               to the local food movement-the ideas that underlie and define
               sustainability can be traced back several centuries.In this
               illuminating and fascinating primer, Jeremy L. Caradonna does
               just that, approaching sustainability from a historical
               perspective and revealing the conditions that gave it shape.
               Locating the underpinnings of the movement as far back as the
               1660s, Caradonna considers the origins of sustainability across
               many fields throughout Europe and North America. Taking us from
               the emergence of thoughts guiding sustainable yield forestry in
               the late 17th and 18th centuries, through the challenges of the
               Industrial Revolution, the birth of the environmental movement,
               and the emergence of a concrete effort to promote a balanced
               approach to development in the latter half of the 20th century,
               he shows that while sustainability draws upon ideas of social
               justice, ecological economics, and environmental conservation,
               it is more than the sum of its parts and blends these ideas
               together into a dynamic philosophy. Caradonna's unique and
               concise history broadens our understanding of what
               ``sustainability'' means, revealing how it progressed from a
               relatively marginal concept to an ideal that shapes everything
               from individual lifestyles, government and corporate strategies,
               and even national and international policy. For anyone seeking
               understand the history of those striving to make the world a

               Global Warming",
  author    = "Ansolabehere, Stephen and Konisky, David M",
  abstract  = "How do Americans think about energy? Is the debate over fossil
               fuels highly partisan and ideological? Does public opinion about
               fossil fuels and alternative energies divide along the fault
               between red states and blue states? And how much do concerns
               about climate change weigh on their opinions? In Cheap and
               Clean, Stephen Ansolabehere and David Konisky show that
               Americans are more pragmatic than ideological in their opinions
               about energy alternatives, more unified than divided about their
               main concerns, and more local than global in their approach to
               energy.Drawing on extensive surveys they designed and conducted
               over the course of a decade (in conjunction with MIT's Energy
               Initiative), Ansolabehere and Konisky report that beliefs about
               the costs and environmental harms associated with particular
               fuels drive public opinions about energy. People approach energy
               choices as consumers, and what is most important to them is
               simply that energy be cheap and clean. Most of us want energy at
               low economic cost and with little social cost (that is, minimal
               health risk from pollution). The authors also find that although
               environmental concerns weigh heavily in people's energy
               preferences, these concerns are local and not global. Worries
               about global warming are less pressing to most than worries
               about their own city's smog and toxic waste. With this in mind,
               Ansolabehere and Konisky argue for policies that target both
               local pollutants and carbon emissions (the main source of global
               warming). The local and immediate nature of people's energy
               concerns can be the starting point for a new approach to energy
               and climate change policy.",

  abstract = "Building energy modeling (BEM) is an approach to model the energy
              usage in buildings for design and retrofit purposes. EnergyPlus
              is the flagship Department of Energy software that performs BEM
              for different types of buildings. The input to EnergyPlus can
              often extend in the order of a few thousand parameters that have
              to be calibrated manually by an expert for realistic energy
              modeling. This makes it challenging and expensive thereby making
              BEM unfeasible for smaller projects. In this paper, we describe
              the ‘Autotune’ research that employs machine learning algorithms
              to generate agents for the different kinds of standard reference
              buildings in the US building stock. The parametric space and the
              variety of building locations and types make this a challenging
              computational problem necessitating the use of supercomputers.
              Millions of EnergyPlus simulations are run on supercomputers that
              are subsequently used to train machine learning algorithms to
              generate agents. These agents, once created, can then run in a
              fraction of the time thereby allowing cost-effective calibration

               accessible to a new generation of statisticians, mathematicians
               and scientists. Sensitivity analysis is used to ascertain how a
               given model output depends upon the input parameters. This is an
               important method for checking the quality of a given model, as
               well as a powerful tool for checking the robustness and
               reliability of its analysis. The topic is acknowledged as
               essential for good modelling practice and is an implicit part of
               any modelling field. Offers an accessible introduction to
               sensitivity analysis. Covers all the latest research.
               Illustrates concepts with numerous examples, applications and
               case studies. Includes contributions from the leading
               researchers active in developing strategies for sensitivity
               analysis. The principles of sensitivity analysis are carefully
               described and suitable methods for approaching many types of
               problems are given. The book introduces the modeller to the
               entire casual assessment chain, from data to predictions, whilst
               explaining the impact of source uncertainties and framing
               assumptions. A ‘hitch-hikers guide’ is included to allow the
               more experienced reader to readily access specific applications.

               Since its initial publication in 1996, the book has been
               critically important in sparking dialogue and triggering
               collaboration across spatial scales and design professions in
               pursuit of buildings, products, and landscapes with radically
               decreased environmental impacts. This 10th anniversary edition
               makes the work available to a new generation of practitioners
               and thinkers concerned with moving our society onto a more
               sustainable path. Using examples from architecture, industrial
               ecology, sustainable agriculture, ecological wastewater
               treatment, and many other fields, Ecological Design provides a
               framework for integrating human design with living systems.
               Drawing on complex systems, ecology, and early examples of green
               building and design, the book challenges us to go further,
               creating buildings, infrastructures, and landscapes that are
               truly restorative rather than merely diminishing the rate at

  author    = "Bartels, Kirsten Allen and Parker, Kelly A",
  abstract  = "Over the coming decades, every academic discipline will have to
               respond to the paradigm of more sustainable life practices
               because students will be living in a world challenged by
               competition for resources and climate change, and will demand
               that every academic discipline demonstrate substantial and
               corresponding relevance. This book takes as its point of
               departure that integrating a component of sustainability into a
               discipline-specific course arises from an educator asking a
               simple question: in the coming decades, as humanity faces
               unprecedented challenges, what can my discipline or area of
               research contribute toward a better understanding of these
               issues? The discipline need not be future-oriented: an
               archaeologist, for instance, could incorporate into a course
               some aspects of sustainable archaeological practices in areas
               threatened by rapid climate change, as well as examples of
               sustainable or unsustainable ways of living practiced by members
               of the long-gone society under investigation. This book also
               argues that courses about sustainability need to cross
               disciplinary boundaries, both because of the inter-relatedness
               of the issues, and because students will require the ability to
               use interdisciplinary approaches to thrive through the multiple
               careers most of them will face.The contributions to this book
               are presented under four sections. ``Sustainability as a Core
               Value in Education'' considers the rationale for incorporating
               sustainability in disciplinary courses. ``Teaching
               Sustainability in the Academic Disciplines'' presents eight
               examples of courses from disciplines as varied as agriculture,
               composition, engineering, and teacher education. ``Education as
               a Sustainable Practice'' reviews how the physical environment of
               the classroom and the delivery of instruction need themselves to
               reflect the values being taught. The final section addresses the
               issues of leadership and long-term institutional change needed
               to embed sustainable practice as a core value on campus.",

               solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the
               workings of the human mindAll our lives are constrained by
               limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular
               set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or
               a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of
               new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling?
               These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not:
               computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer
               scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues
               for decades. And the solutions they've found have much to teach

  abstract  = "This book demystifies the models we use to simulate present and
               future climates, allowing readers to better understand how to
               use climate model results. In order to predict the future
               trajectory of the Earth’s climate, climate-system simulation
               models are necessary. When and how do we trust climate model
               predictions? The book offers a framework for answering this
               question. It provides readers with a basic primer on climate and
               climate change, and offers non-technical explanations for how
               climate models are constructed, why they are uncertain, and what
               level of confidence we should place in them. It presents current
               results and the key uncertainties concerning them. Uncertainty
               is not a weakness but understanding uncertainty is a strength
               and a key part of using any model, including climate models.
               Case studies of how climate model output has been used and how
               it might be used in the future are provided. The ultimate goal
               of this book is to promote a better understanding of the
               structure and uncertainties of climate models among users,
               including scientists, engineers and policymakers.",

               different phases of the model-building process: model
               identification and discrimination; model calibration; model
               corroboration. We review some new global quantitative SA methods
               and suggest that these might enlarge the scope for sensitivity
               analysis in computational and statistical modeling practice.
               Among the advantages of the new methods are their robustness,
               model independence and computational convenience. The discussion

               and Rosbjerg, Dan and Robinson, Bruce A and Zyvoloski, George A",
  abstract  = "In the last few decades hydrologists have made tremendous
               progress in using dynamic simulation models for the analysis and
               understanding of hydrologic systems. However, predictions with
               these models are often deterministic and as such they focus on
               the most probable forecast, without an explicit estimate of the
               associated uncertainty. This uncertainty arises from incomplete
               process representation, uncertainty in initial conditions,
               input, output and parameter error. The generalized likelihood
               uncertainty estimation (GLUE) framework was one of the first
               attempts to represent prediction uncertainty within the context
               of Monte Carlo (MC) analysis coupled with Bayesian estimation
               and propagation of uncertainty. Because of its flexibility, ease
               of implementation and its suitability for parallel
               implementation on distributed computer systems, the GLUE method
               has been used in a wide variety of applications. However, the MC
               based sampling strategy of the prior parameter space typically
               utilized in GLUE is not particularly efficient in finding
               behavioral simulations. This becomes especially problematic for
               high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, and in the case
               of complex simulation models that require significant
               computational time to run and produce the desired output. In
               this paper we improve the computational efficiency of GLUE by
               sampling the prior parameter space using an adaptive Markov
               Chain Monte Carlo scheme (the Shuffled Complex Evolution
               Metropolis (SCEM-UA) algorithm). Moreover, we propose an
               alternative strategy to determine the value of the cutoff
               threshold based on the appropriate coverage of the resulting
               uncertainty bounds. We demonstrate the superiority of this
               revised GLUE method with three different conceptual watershed
               models of increasing complexity, using both synthetic and
               real-world streamflow data from two catchments with different
